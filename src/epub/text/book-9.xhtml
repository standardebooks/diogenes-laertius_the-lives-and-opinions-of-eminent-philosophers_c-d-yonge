				<h3 epub:type="title">Heraclitus</h3>
				<p>Heraclitus was the son of Blyson, or as some say, of Heracion, and a citizen of Ephesus. He flourished about the sixty-ninth olympiad.</p>
				<p>He was above all men of a lofty and arrogant spirit, as is plain from his writings, in which he says: “Abundant learning does not form the mind; for if it did, it would have instructed Hesiod, and Pythagoras, and likewise Xenophanes, and Hecataeus. For the only piece of real wisdom is to know that idea which by itself will govern everything on every occasion.” He used to say, too, that Homer deserved to be expelled from the games and beaten, and Archilochus likewise. He used also to say: “It is more necessary to extinguish insolence than to put out a fire.” Another of his sayings was: “The people ought to fight for the law as for their city.” He also attacks the Ephesians for having banished his companion Hermodorus, when he says: “The Ephesians deserve to have all their youth put to death, and all those who are younger still banished from their city, inasmuch as they have banished Hermodorus, the best man among them, saying: ‘Let no one of us be preeminently good; and if there be any such person, let him go to another city and another people.’ ”</p>
				<p>And when he was requested to make laws for them, he refused, because the city was already immersed in a thoroughly bad constitution. And having retired to the temple of Diana with his children, he began to play at dice; and when all the Ephesians flocked round him, he said: “You wretches, what are you wondering at? is it not better to do this, than to meddle with public affairs in your company?”</p>
				<p>And at last, becoming a complete misanthrope, he used to live spending his time in walking about the mountains, feeding on grasses and plants, and in consequence of these habits, he was attacked by the dropsy, and so then he returned to the city and asked the physicians, in a riddle, whether they were able to produce a drought after wet weather. And as they did not understand him, he shut himself up in a stable for oxen, and covered himself with cow-dung, hoping to cause the wet to evaporate from him by the warmth that this produced. And as he did himself no go good in this way, he died, having lived seventy years; and we have written an epigram upon him which runs thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>I’ve often wondered much at Heraclitus,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he should chose to live so miserably,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And die by such a miserable fate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fell disease did master all his body,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With water quenching all the light of his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bringing darkness o’er his mind and body.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>But Hermippus states that what he asked the physicians was this: whether anyone could draw off the water by depressing his intestines? and when they answered that they could not, he placed himself in the sun, and ordered his servants to plaster him over with cow-dung; and being stretched out in that way, on the second day he died, and was buried in the marketplace. But Neanthes of Cyzicus says that as he could not tear off the cow-dung, he remained there, and on account of the alteration in his appearance, he was not discovered, and so was devoured by the dogs.</p>
				<p>And he was a wonderful person from his boyhood, since while he was young he used to say that he knew nothing, but when he had grown up he then used to affirm that he knew everything. And he was no one’s pupil, but he used to say that he himself had investigated everything, and had learned everything of himself. But Sotion relates that some people affirmed that he had been a pupil of Xenophanes. And that Ariston stated in his account of Heraclitus, that he was cured of the dropsy, and died of some other disease. And Hippobotus gives the same account.</p>
				<p>There is a book of his extant which is about nature generally, and it is divided into three discourses: one on the Universe, one on Politics, and one on Theology. And he deposited this book in the temple of Diana, as some authors report, having written it intentionally in an obscure style, in order that only those who were able men might comprehend it, and that it might not be exposed to ridicule at the hands of the common people. Timon attacks this man also, saying:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Among them came that cuckoo Heraclitus</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The enigmatical obscure reviler</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the common people.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Theophrastus asserts that it was out of melancholy that he left some of his works half-finished, and wrote several in completely different styles; and Antisthenes, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Successions</i>, adduces as a proof of his lofty spirit the fact that he yielded to his brother the title and privileges of royalty.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-121" id="noteref-121" epub:type="noteref">121</a> And his book had so high a reputation that a sect arose in consequence of it, who were called after his own name Heracliteans.</p>
				<p>The following may be set down in a general manner as his main principles: that everything is created from fire, and is dissolved into fire; that everything happens according to destiny, and that all existing things are harmonized, and made to agree together by opposite tendencies; and that all things are full of souls and daemons. He also discussed all the passions which exist in the world, and used also to contend that the sun was of that precise magnitude of which he appears to be. One of his sayings too was that no one, by whatever road he might travel, could ever possibly find out the boundaries of the soul, so deeply hidden are the principles which regulate it. He used also to call opinion the sacred disease; and to say that eyesight was often deceived. Sometimes, in his writings, he expresses himself with great brilliancy and clearness; so that even the most stupid man may easily understand him, and receive an elevation of soul from him. And his conciseness, and the dignity of his style, are incomparable.</p>
				<p>In particulars, his doctrines are of this kind: That fire is an element, and that it is by the changes of fire that all things exist; being engendered sometimes by rarity, some times by density. But he explains nothing clearly. He also says that everything is produced by contrariety, and that everything flows on like a river; that the universe is finite, and that there is one world, and that that is produced from fire, and that the whole world is in its turn again consumed by fire at certain periods, and that all this happens according to fate. That of the contraries, that which leads to production is called war and contest, and that which leads to the conflagration is called harmony and peace; that change is the road leading upward, and the road leading downward; and that the whole world exists according to it.</p>
				<p>For that fire when densified becomes liquid, and becoming concrete, becomes also water; again, that the water when concrete is turned to earth, and that this is the road down; again, that the earth itself becomes fused, from which water is produced, and from that everything else is produced; and then he refers almost everything to the evaporation which takes place from the sea; and this is the road which leads upwards. Also, that there are evaporations both from earth and sea, some of which are bright and clear, and some are dark; and that the fire is increased by the dark ones, and the moisture by the others. But what the space which surrounds us is, he does not explain. He states, however, that there are vessels in it, turned with their hollow part towards us; in which all the bright evaporations are collected and form flames, which are the stars; and that the brightest of these flames, and the hottest, is the light of the sun; for that all the other stars are farther off from the earth; and that on this account, they give less light and warmth; and that the moon is nearer the earth, but does not move through a pure space; the sun, on the other hand, is situated in a transparent space, and one free from all admixture, preserving a well proportioned distance from us, on which account it gives us more light and more heat. And that the sun and moon are eclipsed when the before-mentioned vessels are turned upwards. And that the different phases of the moon take place every month, as its vessel keeps gradually turning round. Moreover, that day and night, and months and years, and rains and winds, and things of that kind, all exist according to, and are caused by, the different evaporations.</p>
				<p>For that the bright evaporation catching fire in the circle of the sun causes day, and the predominance of the opposite one causes night; and again, from the bright one the heat is increased so as to produce summer, and from the dark one the cold gains strength and produces winter; and he also explains the causes of the other phenomena in a corresponding manner.</p>
				<p>But with respect to the earth, he does not explain at all of what character it is, nor does he do so in the case of the vessels; and these were his main doctrines.</p>
				<p>Now, what his opinion about Socrates was, and what expressions he used when he met with a treatise of his which Euripides brought him, according to the story told by Ariston, we have detailed in our account of Socrates. Seleucus the grammarian, however, says that a man of the name of Croton, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diver</i>, relates that it was a person of the name of Crates who first brought this book into Greece; and that he said that he wanted some Delian diver who would not be drowned in it. And the book is described under several titles; some calling it the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Muses</i>, some a treatise on Nature; but Diodotus calls it:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>A well compacted helm to lead a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Straight through the path of life.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Some call it a science of morals, the arrangement of the changes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-122" id="noteref-122" epub:type="noteref">122</a> of unity and of everything.</p>
				<p>They say that when he was asked why he preserved silence, he said: “That you may talk.”</p>
				<p>Darius was very desirous to enjoy his conversation; and wrote thus to him:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<header>
						<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">King Darius, the son of Hystaspes, Addresses Heraclitus of Ephesus, the Wise Man, Greeting Him.</p>
					</header>
					<p>You have written a book on Natural Philosophy, difficult to understand and difficult to explain. Accordingly, if in some parts it is explained literally, it seems to disclose a very important theory concerning the universal world, and all that is contained in it, as they are placed in a state of most divine motion. But commonly, the mind is kept in suspense, so that those who have studied your work the most, are not able precisely to disentangle the exact meaning of your expressions. Therefore, king Darius, the son of Hystaspes wishes to enjoy the benefit of hearing you discourse, and of receiving some Grecian instruction. Come, therefore, quickly to my sight, and to my royal palace; for the Greeks, in general, do not accord to wise men the distinction which they deserve, and disregard the admirable expositions delivered by them, which are, however, worthy of being seriously listened to and studied; but with me you shall have every kind of distinction and honor, and you shall enjoy every day honorable and worthy conversation, and your pupils’ life shall become virtuous, in accordance with your precepts.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
					<header>
						<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Heraclitus, of Ephesus, to King Darius, the Son of Hystaspes, Greeting</p>
					</header>
					<p>All the men that exist in the world are far removed from truth and just dealings; but they are full of evil foolishness, which leads them to insatiable covetousness and vainglorious ambition. I, however, forgetting all their worthlessness, and shunning satiety, and who wish to avoid all envy on the part of my countrymen, and all appearance of arrogance, will never come to Persia, since I am quite contented with a little, and live as best suits my own inclination.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This was the way in which the man behaved even to the king. And Demetrius, in his treatise on People of the Same Name, says that he also despised the Athenians, among whom he had a very high reputation. And that though he was himself despised by the Ephesians, he nevertheless preferred his own home. Demetrius Phalereus also mentions him in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Defense of Socrates</i>.</p>
				<p>There were many people who undertook to interpret his book. For Antisthenes and Heraclides, Ponticus, and Cleanthes, and Sphaerus the Stoic; and besides them Pausanias, who was surnamed Heraclitistes, and Nicomedes, and Dionysius, all did so. And of the grammarians, Diodotus undertook the same task; and he says that the subject of the book is not natural philosophy, but politics; and that all that is said in it about natural philosophy, is only by way of illustration. And Hieronymus tells us that a man of the name of Scythinus, an iambic poet, attempted to render the book into verse.</p>
				<p>There are many epigrams extant which were written upon him, and this is one of them:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>I who lie here am Heraclitus, spare me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye rude unlettered men: ’Twas not for you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I did labor, but for wiser people.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One man may be to me a countless host,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And an unnumbered multitude be no one;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this I still say in the shades below.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And there is another expressed thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Be not too hasty, skimming o’er the book</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Heraclitus; ’tis a difficult road,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For mist is there, and darkness hard to pierce.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But if you have a guide who knows his system,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then everything is clearer than the sun.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>There were five people of the name of Heraclitus: The first was this philosopher of ours. The second a lyric poet, who wrote a panegyrical hymn on the Twelve Gods. The third was an Elegiac poet, of Halicarnassus, on whom Callimachus wrote the following epigram:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>I heard, O Heraclitus, of your death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the news filled my eyes with mournful tears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When I remembered all the happy hours</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When we with talk beguiled the setting sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You now are dust; but still the honeyed voice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of your sweet converse doth and will survive;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor can fell death, which all things else destroys,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay upon that his ruthless conquering grasp.</span>
					</p>

				<p class="continued">The fourth was a Lesbian, who wrote a history of Macedonia. The fifth was a man who blended jest with earnest, and who, having been a harp-player, abandoned that profession for a seriocomic style of writing.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Xenophanes</h3>
				<p>Xenophanes was the son of Dexius, or, as Apollodorus says, of Orthomenes. He was a citizen of Colophon; and is praised by Timon. Accordingly, he says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Xenophanes, not much a slave to vanity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wise reprover of the tricks of Homer.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">He, having been banished from his own country, lived at Zancle in Sicily, and at Catana.</p>
				<p>And according to the statements made by some people, he was a pupil of no one; but as others say, he was a pupil of Boton the Athenian; or as another account again affirms, of Archelaus. He was, if we may believe Sotion, a contemporary of Anaximander.</p>
				<p>He wrote poems in hexameter and in elegiac verse; and also he wrote iambics against Hesiod and Homer, attacking the things said in their poems about the Gods. He also used to recite his own poems. It is said likewise that he argued against the opinions of Thales and Pythagoras, and that he also attacked Epimenides. He lived to an extreme old age; as he says somewhere himself:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Threescore and seven long years are fully passed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since first my doctrines spread abroad through Greece:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ’twixt that time and my first view of light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Six lustres more must added be to them:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If I am right at all about my age,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lacking but eight years of a century.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>His doctrine was that there were four elements of existing things; and an infinite number of worlds, which were all unchangeable. He thought that the clouds were produced by the vapor which was borne upwards from the sun, and which lifted them up into the circumambient space. That the essence of God was of a spherical form, in no respect resembling man; that the universe could see, and that the universe could hear, but could not breathe; and that it was in all its parts intellect, and wisdom, and eternity. He was the first person who asserted that everything which is produced is perishable, and that the soul is a spirit. He used also to say that the many was inferior to unity. Also, that we ought to associate with tyrants either as little as possible, or else as pleasantly as possible.</p>
				<p>When Empedocles said to him that the wise man was undiscoverable, he replied: “Very likely; for it takes a wise man to discover a wise man.” And Sotion says that he was the first person who asserted that everything is incomprehensible. But he is mistaken in this.</p>
				<p>Xenophanes wrote a poem on the Founding of Colophon; and also, on the Colonisation of Elea, in Italy, consisting of two thousand verses. And he flourished about the sixtieth olympiad.</p>
				<p>Demetrius Phalereus, in his treatise on Old Age, and Phenaetius the Stoic, in his essay on Cheerfulness, relate that he buried his sons with his own hands, as Anaxagoras had also done. And he seems to have been detested<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-123" id="noteref-123" epub:type="noteref">123</a> by the Pythagoreans, Parmeniscus, and Orestades, as Phavorinus relates in the first book of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Commentaries</i>.</p>
				<p>There was also another Xenophanes, a native of Lesbos, and an iambic poet.</p>
				<p>These are the Promiscuous or unattached philosophers.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="part-9-3">
				<h3 epub:type="title">Parmenides</h3>
				<p>Parmenides, the son of Pyres and a citizen of Velia, was a pupil of Xenophanes. And Theophrastus, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Abridgment</i>, says that he was also a pupil of Anaximander. However, though he was a pupil of Xenophanes, he was not afterwards a follower of his; but he attached himself to Aminias, and Diochaetes the Pythagorean, as Sotion relates, which last was a poor but honorable and virtuous man. And he it was whose follower he became, and after he was dead he erected a shrine, or <i xml:lang="grc">ἡρῷον</i>, in his honor. And so Parmenides, who was of a noble family and possessed of considerable wealth, was induced, not by Xenophanes but by Aminias, to embrace the tranquil life of a philosopher.</p>
				<p>He was the first person who asserted that the earth was of a spherical form, and that it was situated in the center of the universe. He also taught that there were two elements: fire and earth; and that one of them occupies the place of the maker, the other that of the matter. He also used to teach that man was originally made out of clay; and that they were composed of two parts, the hot and the cold; of which, in fact, everything consists. Another of his doctrines was that the mind and the soul were the same thing, as we are informed by Theophrastus in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Natural Philosophy</i>, when he enumerates the theories of nearly all the different philosophers.</p>
				<p>He also used to say that philosophy was of a twofold character: one kind resting on certain truth, the other on opinion. On which account he says somewhere:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>And ’twill be needful for you well to know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fearless heart of all-convincing truth:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Also the opinions, though less sure, of men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which rest upon no certain evidence.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Parmenides too philosophizes in his poems; as Hesiod and Xenophanes and Empedocles used to. And he used to say that argument was the test of truth; and that the sensations were not trustworthy witnesses. Accordingly, he says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Let not the common usages of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Persuade your better taught experience,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To trust to men’s unsafe deceitful sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or treacherous ears, or random speaking tongue:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reason alone will prove the truth of facts.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>On which account Timon says of him:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>The vigorous mind of wise Parmenides,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who classes all the errors of the thoughts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Under vain fantasies.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Plato inscribed one of his dialogues with his name: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parmenides</i>, or an essay on Ideas. He flourished about the sixty-ninth Olympiad. He appears to have been the first person who discovered that Hesperus and Lucifer were the same star, as Phavorinus records, in the fifth book of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Commentaries</i>. Some, however, attribute this discovery to Pythagoras. And Callimachus asserts that the poem in which this doctrine is promulgated is not his work.</p>
				<p>He is said also to have given laws to his fellow-citizens, as Speusippus records in his account of the Philosophers. He was also the first employer of the question called the Achilles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-124" id="noteref-124" epub:type="noteref">124</a> as Phavorinus assures us in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Universal History</i>.</p>
				<p>There was also another Parmenides, an orator, who wrote a treatise on the art of Oratory.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="part-9-4">
				<h3 epub:type="title">Melissus</h3>
				<p>Melissus was a Samian, and the son of Ithagenes. He was a pupil of Parmenides; but he also had conversed with Heraclitus, when he recommended him to the Ephesians, who were unacquainted with him, as Hippocrates recommended Democritus to the people of Abdera.</p>
				<p>He was a man greatly occupied in political affairs, and held in great esteem among his fellow citizens; on which account he was elected admiral. And he was admired still more on account of his private virtues.</p>
				<p>His doctrine was that the Universe was infinite, unsusceptible of change, immoveable, and one, being always like to itself and complete; and that there was no such thing as real motion, but that there only appeared to be such. As respecting the Gods, too, he denied that there was any occasion to give a definition of them, for that there was no certain knowledge of them.</p>
				<p>Apollodorus states that he flourished about the eighty-fourth olympiad.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="part-9-5">
				<h3 epub:type="title">Zeno, the Eleatic</h3>
				<p>Zeno was a native of Velia. Apollodorus, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Chronicles</i>, says that he was by nature the son of Teleutagoras, but by adoption the son of Parmenides.</p>
				<p>Timon speaks thus of him and Melissus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Great is the strength, invincible the might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Zeno, skilled to argue on both sides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of any question, th’ universal critic;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of Melissus too. They rose superior</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To prejudice in general; only yielding</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To very few.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And Zeno had been a pupil of Parmenides, and had been on other accounts greatly attached to him.</p>
				<p>He was a tall man, as Plato tells us in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parmenides</i>, and the same writer, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Phaedrus</i>, calls him also the Eleatic Palamedes.</p>
				<p>Aristotle, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sophist</i>, says that he was the inventor of dialectics, as Empedocles was of rhetoric. And he was a man of the greatest nobleness of spirit, both in philosophy and in politics. There are also many books extant which are attributed to him, full of great learning and wisdom.</p>
				<p>He, wishing to put an end to the power of Nearches the tyrant (some, however, call the tyrant Diomedon), was arrested, as we are informed by Heraclides in his abridgment of Satyrus. And when he was examined, as to his accomplices and as to the arms which he was taking to Lipara, he named all the friends of the tyrant as his accomplices, wishing to make him feel himself alone. And then, after he had mentioned some names, he said that he wished to whisper something privately to the tyrant; and when he came near him he bit him, and would not leave his hold till he was stabbed. And the same thing happened to Aristogiton, the tyrant slayer. But Demetrius, in his treatise on People of the Same Name, says that it was his nose that he bit off.</p>
				<p>Moreover, Antisthenes, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Successions</i>, says that after he had given him information against his friends, he was asked by the tyrant if there was anyone else. And he replied: “Yes, you, the destruction of the city.” And that he also said to the bystanders: “I marvel at your cowardice, if you submit to be slaves to the tyrant out of fear of such pains as I am now enduring.” And at last he bit off his tongue and spit it at him; and the citizens immediately rushed forward, and slew the tyrant with stones. And this is the account that is given by almost everyone.</p>
				<p>But Hermippus says that he was put into a mortar, and pounded to death. And we ourselves have written the following epigram on him:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Your noble wish, O Zeno, was to slay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cruel tyrant, freeing Elea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the harsh bonds of shameful slavery,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But you were disappointed; for the tyrant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pounded you in a mortar. I say wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He only crushed your body, and not you.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And Zeno was an excellent man in other respects, and he was also a despiser of great men in an equal degree with Heraclitus; for he, too, preferred the town which was formerly called Hyele, and afterwards Elea, being a colony of the Phocaeans, and his own native place, a poor city possessed of no other importance than the knowledge of how to raise virtuous citizens, to the pride of the Athenians; so that he did not often visit them, but spent his life at home.</p>
				<p>He, too, was the first man who asked the question called Achilles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-125" id="noteref-125" epub:type="noteref">125</a> though Phavorinus attributes its first use to Parmenides, and several others.</p>
				<p>His chief doctrines were that there were several worlds, and that there was no vacuum; that the nature of all things consisted of hot and cold, and dry and moist, these elements interchanging their substances with one another; that man was made out of the earth, and that his soul was a mixture of the before-named elements in such a way that no one of them predominated.</p>
				<p>They say that when he was reproached, he was indignant; and that when someone blamed him, he replied: “If when I am reproached, I am not angered, then I shall not be pleased when I am praised.”</p>
				<p>We have already said in our account of the Citiaean, that there were eight Zenos; but this one flourished about the seventy-ninth olympiad.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Leucippus</h3>
				<p>Leucippus was a native of Velia; but as some say, of Abdera, and as others report, of Melos.</p>
				<p>He was a pupil of Zeno. And his principal doctrines were that all things were infinite, and were interchanged with one another; and that the universe was a vacuum, and full of bodies; also that the worlds were produced by bodies falling into the vacuum, and becoming entangled with one another; and that the nature of the stars originated in motion, according to their increase; also, that the sun is borne round in a greater circle around the moon; that the earth is carried on revolving round the center; and that its figure resembles a drum; he was the first philosopher who spoke of atoms as principles.</p>
				<p>These are his doctrines in general; in particular detail, they are as follow: he says that the universe is infinite, as I have already mentioned; that of it, one part is a plenum, and the other a vacuum. He also says that the elements, and the worlds which are derived from them, are infinite, and are dissolved again into them; and that the worlds are produced in this manner: That many bodies, of various kinds and shapes, are borne by amputation from the infinite, into a vast vacuum; and then they, being collected together, produce one vortex; according to which they, dashing against one another, and whirling about in every direction, are separated in such a way that like attaches itself to like.</p>
				<p>But as they are all of equal weight, when by reason of their number they are no longer able to whirl about, the thin ones depart into the outer vacuum, as if they bounded through, and the others remain behind, and becoming entangled with one another, run together, and produce a sort of spherical shaped figure.</p>
				<p>This subsists as a kind of membrane; containing within itself bodies of every kind; and as these are whirled about so as to revolve according to the resistance of the center, the circumambient membrane becomes thin, since bodies are without ceasing, uniting according to the impulse given by the vortex; and in this way the earth is produced, since these bodies which have once been brought to the center remain there.</p>
				<p>On the other side, there is produced another enveloping membrane, which increases incessantly by the accretion of exterior bodies; and which, as it is itself animated by a circular movement, drags with it, and adds to itself, everything it meets with; some of these bodies thus enveloped reunite again and form compounds, which are at first moist and clayey, but soon becoming dry, and being drawn on in the universal movement of the circular vortex, they catch fire, and constitute the substance of the stars. The orbit of the sun is the most distant one; that of the moon is the nearest to the earth; and between the two are the orbits of the other stars.</p>
				<p>All the stars are set on fire by the rapidity of their own motion; and the sun is set on fire by the stars; the moon has only a slight quantity of fire; the sun and the moon are eclipsed in⁠ ⁠…<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-126" id="noteref-126" epub:type="noteref">126</a> in consequence of the inclination of the earth towards the south. In the north it always snows, and those districts are cold, and are often frozen.</p>
				<p>The sun is eclipsed but seldom; but the moon frequently, because her orbits are unequal.</p>
				<p>Leucippus admits also that the production of worlds, their increase, their diminution, and their destruction, depend on a certain necessity, the character of which he does not precisely explain.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Democritus</h3>
				<p>Democritus was the son of Hegesistratus, but as some say of Athenocrites, and according to other accounts of Damasippus. He was a native of Abdera, or as it is stated by some authors a citizen of Miletus.</p>
				<p>He was a pupil of some of the Magi and Chaldaeans, whom Xerxes had left with his father as teachers, when he had been hospitably received by him, as Herodotus informs us;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-127" id="noteref-127" epub:type="noteref">127</a> and from these men he, while still a boy, learned the principles of astronomy and theology. Afterwards, his father entrusted him to Leucippus, and to Anaxagoras, as some authors assert, who was forty years older than he. And Phavorinus, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Universal History</i>, says that Democritus said of Anaxagoras that his opinions about the sun and moon were not his own, but were old theories, and that he had stolen them. And that he used also to pull to pieces his assertions about the composition of the world, and about mind, as he was hostile to him, because he had declined to admit him as a pupil. How then can he have been a pupil of his, as some assert? And Demetrius in his treatise on People of the Same Name, and Antisthenes in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Successions</i>, both affirm that he travelled to Egypt to see the priests there, and to learn mathematics of them; and that he proceeded further to the Chaldaeans, and penetrated into Persia, and went as far as the Persian Gulf. Some also say that he made acquaintance with the Gymnosophists in India, and that he went to Aethiopia.</p>
				<p>He was one of three brothers who divided their patrimony among them; and the most common story is that he took the smaller portion, as it was in money, because he required money for the purpose of travelling; though his brothers suspected him of entertaining some treacherous design. And Demetrius says that his share amounted to more than a hundred talents, and that he spent the whole of it.</p>
				<p>He also says that he was so industrious a man that he cut off for himself a small portion of the garden which surrounded his house, in which there was a small cottage, and shut himself up in it. And on one occasion, when his father brought him an ox to sacrifice, and fastened it there, he for a long time did not discover it, until his father having roused him, on the pretext of the sacrifice, told him what he had done with the ox.</p>
				<p>He further asserts that it is well known that he went to Athens, and as he despised glory, he did not desire to be known; and that he became acquainted with Socrates, without Socrates knowing who he was. “For I came,” says he, “to Athens, and no one knew me.”⁠—“If,” says Thrasylus, “the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rivals</i> is really the work of Plato, then Democritus must be the anonymous interlocutor, who is introduced in that dialogue, besides Oenopides and Anaxagoras, the one I mean who, in the conversation with Socrates, is arguing about philosophy, and whom the philosopher tells that a philosopher resembles a conqueror in the Pentathlum.” And he was veritably a master of five branches of philosophy. For he was thoroughly acquainted with physics, and ethics, and mathematics, and the whole encyclic system, and indeed he was thoroughly experienced and skillful in every kind of art. He it was who was the author of the saying: “Speech is the shadow of action.” But Demetrius Phalereus, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Defense of Socrates</i>, affirms that he never came to Athens at all. And that is a still stranger circumstance than any, if he despised so important a city, not wishing to derive glory from the place in which he was, but preferring rather himself to invest the place with glory.</p>
				<p>And it is evident from his writings what sort of man he was. “He seems,” says Thrasylus, “to have been also an admirer of the Pythagoreans.” And he mentions Pythagoras himself, speaking of him with admiration, in the treatise which is inscribed with his name. And he appears to have derived all his doctrines from him to such a degree, that one would have thought that he had been his pupil, if the difference of time did not prevent it. At all events, Glaucus of Rhegium, who was a contemporary of his, affirms that he was a pupil of some of the Pythagorean school.</p>
				<p>And Apollodorus of Cyzicus says that he was intimate with Philolaus; “He used to practice himself,” says Antisthenes, “in testing perceptions in various manners; sometimes retiring into solitary places, and spending his time even among tombs.”</p>
				<p>And he further adds that when he returned from his travels he lived in a most humble manner, like a man who had spent all his property, and that on account of his poverty he was supported by his brother Damasus. But when he had foretold some future event which happened as he had predicted, and had in consequence become famous, he was for all the rest of his life thought worthy of almost divine honors by the generality of people. And as there was a law that a man who had squandered the whole of his patrimony should not be allowed funeral rites in his country, Antisthenes says that he, being aware of this law and not wishing to be exposed to the calumnies of those who envied him and would be glad to accuse him, recited to the people his work called the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Great World</i>, which is far superior to all his other writings, and that as a reward for it he was presented with five hundred talents; and not only that, but he also had some brazen statues erected in his honor. And when he died, he was buried at the public expense; after having attained the age of more than a hundred years. But Demetrius says that it was his relations who read the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Great World</i>, and that they were presented with a hundred talents only; and Hippobotus coincides in this statement.</p>
				<p>And Aristoxenus, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Historic Commentaries</i>, says that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he was able to collect; but that Amyclas and Cleinias, the Pythagoreans, prevented him, as it would do no good, for that copies of his books were already in many hands. And it is plain that that was the case; for Plato, who mentions nearly all the ancient philosophers, nowhere speaks of Democritus, not even in those passages where he has occasion to contradict his theories; evidently, because he said that if he did, he would be showing his disagreement with the best of all philosophers; a man whom even Timon praises in the following terms:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Like that Democritus, wisest of men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sage ruler of his speech; profound converser,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose works I love to read among the first.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>But he was, according to the statement made by himself in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Little World</i>, a youth when Anaxagoras was an old man, being forty years younger than he was. And he says that he composed the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Little World</i> seven hundred and thirty years after the capture of Troy. And he must have been born, according to the account given by Apollodorus in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Chronicles</i>, in the eightieth olympiad; but, as Thrasylus says, in his work entitled the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Events</i>, which took place before the reading of the books of Democritus, in the third year of the seventy-seventh olympiad, being, as it is there stated, one year older than Socrates. He must therefore have been a contemporary of Archelaus, the pupil of Anaxagoras, and of Oenopides, for he makes mention of this letter. He also speaks of the theories of Parmenides and Zeno, on the subject of the One, as they were the men of the highest reputation in histories, and he also speaks of Protagoras of Abdera, who confessedly lived at the same time as Socrates.</p>
				<p>Athenodorus tells us, in the eighth book of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Conversations</i>, that once, when Hippocrates came to see him, he ordered some milk to be brought; and that, when he saw the milk, he said that it was the milk of a black goat, with her first kid; on which Hippocrates marvelled at his accurate knowledge. Also, as a young girl came with Hippocrates, on the first day he saluted her thus: “Good morning, my maid;” but on the next day: “Good morning, woman;” for, indeed, she had ceased to be a maid during the night.</p>
				<p>And Hermippus relates that Democritus died in the following manner: he was exceedingly old, and appeared at the point of death; and his sister was lamenting that he would die during the festival of the Thesmophoria,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-128" id="noteref-128" epub:type="noteref">128</a> and so prevent her from discharging her duties to the Goddess; and so he bade her be of good cheer, and desired her to bring him hot loaves every day. And, by applying these to his nostrils, he kept himself alive even over the festival. But when the days of the festival were passed (and it lasted three days), then he expired, without any pain, as Hipparchus assures us, having lived a hundred and nine years. And we have written an epigram upon him in our collection of poems in every meter, which runs thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>What man was e’er so wise, who ever did</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So great a deed as this Democritus?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who kept off death, though present for three days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And entertained him with hot steam of bread.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Such was the life of this man.</p>
				<p>Now his principal doctrines were these: That atoms and the vacuum were the beginning of the universe, and that everything else existed only in opinion. That the worlds were infinite, created, and perishable. But that nothing was created out of nothing, and that nothing was destroyed so as to become nothing. That the atoms were infinite both in magnitude and number, and were borne about through the universe in endless revolutions. And that thus they produced all the combinations that exist; fire, water, air, and earth; for that all these things are only combinations of certain atoms; which combinations are incapable of being affected by external circumstances, and are unchangeable by reason of their solidity. Also, that the sun and the moon are formed by such revolutions and round bodies; and in like manner the soul is produced; and that the soul and the mind are identical; that we see by the falling of visions across our sight; and that everything that happens, happens of necessity. Motion, being the cause of the production of everything, which he calls necessity. The chief good he asserts to be cheerfulness, which, however, he does not consider the same as pleasure, as some people who have misunderstood him have fancied that he meant; but he understands by cheerfulness, a condition according to which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, or superstition, or other passion. He calls this state <i xml:lang="grc">εὐθυμία</i>, and <i xml:lang="grc">εὐεστὼ</i>, and several other names. Everything which is made he looks upon as depending for its existence on opinion; but atoms and the vacuum he believes exist by nature. These were his principal opinions.</p>
				<p>Of his books, Thrasylus has given a regular catalog, in the same way that he has arranged the works of Plato, dividing them into four classes.</p>
				<p>Now these are his ethical works: The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Pythagoras</i>; a treatise on the Disposition of the Wise Man; an essay on those in the Shades Below; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tritogeneia</i> (this is so called because from Minerva three things are derived which hold together all human affairs); a treatise on Manly Courage or Valor; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Horn of Amalthea</i>; an essay on Cheerfulness; a volume of Ethical Commentaries. A treatise entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">For Cheerfulness</i>, (<i xml:lang="grc">εὐεστὼ</i>) is not found.</p>
				<p>These are his writings on natural philosophy: The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Great World</i> (which Theophrastus asserts to be the work of Leucippus); the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Little World</i>; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cosmography</i>; a treatise on the Planets; the first book on Nature; two books on the Nature of Man, or on Flesh; an essay on the Mind; one on the Senses (some people join these two together in one volume, which they entitle, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">On the Soul</i>); a treatise on Juices; one on Colors; one on the Different Figures; one on the Changes of Figures; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cratynteria</i> (that is to say, an essay, approving of what has been said in preceding ones); a treatise on Phenomenon, or on Providence; three books on Pestilences, or Pestilential Evils; a book of Difficulties. These are his books on natural philosophy.</p>
				<p>His miscellaneous works are these: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Heavenly Causes</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Aerial Causes</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Causes Affecting Plane Surfaces</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Causes Referring to Fire, and to What Is in Fire</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Causes Affecting Voices</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Causes Affecting Seeds, and Plants, and Fruits</i>; three books of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Causes Affecting Animals</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Miscellaneous Causes</i>; a treatise on the Magnet. These are his miscellaneous works.</p>
				<p>His mathematical writings are the following: A treatise on the Difference of Opinion, or on the Contact of the Circle and the Sphere; one on Geometry; one on Numbers; one on Incommensurable Lines, and Solids, in two books; a volume called <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Explanations</i>; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Great Year</i>, or the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Astronomical Calendar</i>; a discussion on the Clepsydra; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Map of the Heavens</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Geography</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Polography</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Actinography</i>, or a discussion on Rays of Light. These are his mathematical works.</p>
				<p>His works on music are the following: A treatise on Rhythm and Harmony; one on Poetry; one on the beauty of Epic Poems; one on Euphonious and Discordant Letters; one on Homer, or on Propriety of Diction<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-129" id="noteref-129" epub:type="noteref">129</a> and Dialects; one on Song, one on Words; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Onomasticon</i>. These are his musical works.</p>
				<p>The following are his works on art: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prognostics</i>; a treatise on the Way of Living, called also <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Diaetetics</i>, or the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Opinions of a Physician</i>; Causes relating to Unfavorable and Favorable Opportunities; a treatise on Agriculture, called also the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Georgic</i>; one on Painting; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tactics, and Fighting in Heavy Armour</i>. These are his works on such subjects.</p>
				<p>Some authors also give a list of some separate treatises which they collect from his Commentaries. A treatise on the Sacred Letters seen at Babylon; another on the Sacred Letters seen at Meroe; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Voyage Round the Ocean</i>; a treatise on History; a Chaldaic Discourse; a Phrygian Discourse; a treatise on Fever; an essay on those who are attacked with Cough after illness; the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Principles of Laws</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Things Made by Hand</i>, or <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Problems</i>.</p>
				<p>As to the other books which some writers ascribed to him, some are merely extracts from his other writings, and some are confessedly the work of others. And this is a sufficient account of his writings.</p>
				<p>There were six people of the name of Democritus: The first was this man of whom we are speaking; the second was a musician of Chios, who lived about the same time; the third was a sculptor who is mentioned by Antigonus; the fourth is a man who wrote a treatise on the Temple at Ephesus, and on the city of Samothrace; the fifth was an epigrammatic poet, of great perspicuity and elegance; the sixth was a citizen of Pergamus, who wrote a treatise on Oratory.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Protagoras</h3>
				<p>Protagoras was the son of Artemon, or as Apollodorus says (which account is corroborated by Deinon, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Persia</i>) of Maeander. He was a native of Abdera, as Heraclides Ponticus tell us, in his treatise on Laws; and the same authority informs us that he made laws for the Thurians. But, according to the statement of Eupolis, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Flatterers</i>, he was a native of Teos; for he says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Within you’ll find Protagoras, of Teos.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>He, and Prodicus of Ceos, used to levy contributions for giving their lectures; and Plato, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Protagoras</i>, says that Prodicus had a very powerful voice.</p>
				<p>Protagoras was a pupil of Democritus. And he was surnamed Wisdom, as Phavorinus informs us in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Universal History</i>.</p>
				<p>He was the first person who asserted that in every question there were two sides to the argument exactly opposite to one another. And he used to employ them in his arguments, being the first person who did so. But he began something in this manner: “Man is the measure of all things: of those things which exist as he is; and of those things which do not exist as he is not.” And he used to say that nothing else was soul except the senses, as Plato says, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Theaetetus</i>; and that everything was true. And another of his treatises he begins in this way: “Concerning the Gods, I am not able to know to a certainty whether they exist or whether they do not. For there are many things which prevent one from knowing, especially the obscurity of the subject, and the shortness of the life of man.” And on account of this beginning of his treatise, he was banished by the Athenians. And they burnt his books in the marketplace, calling them in by the public crier, and compelling all who possessed them to surrender them.</p>
				<p>He was the first person who demanded payment of his pupils; fixing his charge at a hundred minae. He was also the first person who gave a precise definition of the parts of time; and who explained the value of opportunity, and who instituted contests of argument, and who armed the disputants with the weapon of sophism. He it was too who first left facts out of consideration, and fastened his arguments on words; and who was the parent of the present superficial and futile kinds of discussion. On which account Timon says of him:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Protagoras, that slippery arguer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In disputatious contests fully skilled.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>He too it was who first invented that sort of argument which is called the Socratic, and who first employed the reasonings of Antisthenes, which attempt to establish the point that they cannot be contradicted; as Plato tells us in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Euthydemus</i>. He was also the first person who practiced regular discussions on set subjects, as Artemidorus the dialectician, tells us in his treatise against Chrysippus. He was also the original inventor of the porter’s pad for men to carry their burdens on, as we are assured by Aristotle, in his book on Education; for he himself was a porter, as Epicurus says somewhere or other. And it was in this way that he became highly thought of by Democritus, who saw him as he was tying up some sticks.</p>
				<p>He was also the first person who divided discourse into four parts: entreaty, interrogation, answer, and injunction; though some writers make the parts seven: narration, interrogation, answer, injunction, promise, entreaty, and invocation; and these he called the foundations of discourse; but Alcidamas says that there are four divisions of discourse: affirmation, denial, interrogation, and invocation.</p>
				<p>The first of his works that he ever read in public was the treatise on the Gods, the beginning of which we have quoted above, and he read this at Athens in the house of Euripides, or as some say, in that of Megaclides; others say that he read it in the Lyceum; his pupil Archagoras, the son of Theodotus, giving him the aid of his voice. His accuser was Pythodorus, the son of Polyzelus, one of the four hundred; but Aristotle calls him Evathlus.</p>
				<p>The writings of his which are still extant are these: a treatise on the Art of Contention; one on Wrestling; one on Mathematics; one on a Republic; one on Ambition; one on Virtues; one on the Original Condition of Man; one on those in the Shades Below; one on the Things which are not done properly by Men; one volume of Precepts; one essay entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Justice in Pleading for Hire</i>; two books of Contradictions.</p>
				<p>These are his books.</p>
				<p>Plato also addressed a dialogue to him.</p>
				<p>Philochorus relates that as he was sailing to Sicily his ship was wrecked, and that this circumstance is alluded to by Euripides in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Ixion</i>; and some say that he died on his journey, being about ninety years old. But Apollodorus states his age at seventy years, and says that he was a sophist forty years, and that he flourished about the eighty-fourth Olympiad. There is an epigram upon him written by myself, in the following terms:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>I hear accounts of you, Protagoras,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, travelling far from Athens, on the road,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You, an old man, and quite infirm, did die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Cecrops’ city drove you forth to exile;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But you, though ’scaping dread Minerva’s might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could not escape the outspread arms of Pluto.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>It is said that once, when he demanded of Evathlus his pupil payment for his lessons, Evathlus said to him: “But I have never been victorious in an argument;” and he rejoined: “But if I gain my cause, then I should naturally receive the fruits of my victory, and so would you obtain the fruits of yours.”</p>
				<p>There was also another Protagoras, an astronomer, on whom Euphorion wrote an elegy; and a third also, who was a philosopher of the Stoic sect.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Diogenes of Apollonia</h3>
				<p>Diogenes was a native of Apollonia, and the son of Apollothemis, a natural philosopher of high reputation; and he was, as Antisthenes reports, a pupil of Anaximenes. He was also a contemporary of Anaxagoras, and Demetrius Phalereus says in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Defense of Socrates</i> that he was very unpopular at Athens, and even in some danger of his life.</p>
				<p>The following were his principal doctrines: that the air was an element; that the worlds were infinite, and that the vacuum also was infinite; that the air, as it was condensed, and as it was rarified, was the productive cause of the worlds; that nothing can be produced out of nothing;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-130" id="noteref-130" epub:type="noteref">130</a> and that nothing can be destroyed so as to become nothing; that the earth is round, firmly planted in the middle of the universe, having acquired its situation from the circumvolutions of the hot principle around it, and its consistency from the cold.</p>
				<p>The first words of his treatise are:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>It appears to me that he who begins any treatise ought to lay down principles about which there can be no dispute, and that his exposition of them ought to be simple and dignified.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Anaxarchus</h3>
				<p>Anaxarchus was a native of Abdera. He was a pupil of Diogenes of Smyrna; but, as some say, of Metrodorus of Chios; who said that he was not even sure that he knew nothing; and Metrodorus was a pupil of Nessus, of Chios; though others assert that he was a disciple of Democritus.</p>
				<p>Anaxarchus too enjoyed the intimacy of Alexander, and flourished about the hundred and tenth olympiad. He had for an enemy Nicocreon, the tyrant of Cyprus. And on one occasion, when Alexander, at a banquet, asked him what he thought of the entertainment, he is said to have replied: “O king, everything is provided very sumptuously; and the only thing wanting is to have the head of some satrap served up,” hinting at Nicocreon. And Nicocreon did not forget his grudge against him for this; but after the death of the king, when Anaxarchus, who was making a voyage, was driven against his will into Cyprus, he took him and put him in a mortar, and commanded him to be pounded to death with iron pestles. And then they say that he, disregarding this punishment, uttered that celebrated saying: “Beat the bag of Anaxarchus, but you will not beat Anaxarchus himself.” And then, when Nicocreon commanded that his tongue should be cut out, it is said that he bit it off, and spit it at him. And we have written an epigram upon him in the following terms:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Beat more and more; you’re beating but a bag;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beat, Anaxarchus is in heav’n with Jove.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hereafter Proserpine will rack your bones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And say, Thus perish, you accursed beater.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Anaxarchus, on account of the evenness of his temper and the tranquillity of his life, was called the Happy. And he was a man to whom it was very easy to reprove men and bring them to temperance. Accordingly, he produced an alteration in Alexander who thought himself a God, for when he saw the blood flowing from some wound that he had received, he pointed to him with his finger, and said: “This is blood, and not:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>“Such stream as issues from a wounded God;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pure emanation, uncorrupted flood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unlike our gross, diseas’d, terrestrial blood.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-131" id="noteref-131" epub:type="noteref">131</a></span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">But Plutarch says that it was Alexander himself who quoted these lines to his friends.</p>
				<p>They also tell a story that Anaxarchus once drank to him, and then showed the goblet, and said:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">

				<h3 epub:type="title">Pyrrho</h3>
				<p>Pyrrho was a citizen of Elis, and the son of Pleistarchus, as Diocles informs us, and, as Apollodorus in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Chronicles</i> asserts, he was originally a painter.</p>
				<p>And he was a pupil of Bryson, the son of Stilpon, as we are told by Alexander in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Chronicles</i>. After that he attached himself to Anaxarchus, and attended him everywhere; so that he even went as far as the Gymnosophists, in India, and the Magi.</p>
				<p>Owing to which circumstance, he seems to have taken a noble line in philosophy, introducing the doctrine of incomprehensibility, and of the necessity of suspending one’s judgment, as we learn from Ascanius of Abdera. For he used to say that nothing was honorable, or disgraceful, or just, or unjust. And on the same principle he asserted that there was no such thing as downright truth; but that men did everything in consequence of custom and law. For that nothing was any more this than that. And his life corresponded to his principles; for he never shunned anything, and never guarded against anything; encountering everything, even wagons for instance, and precipices, and dogs, and everything of that sort; committing nothing whatever to his senses. So that he used to be saved, as Antigonus the Carystian tells us, by his friends who accompanied him. And Aenesidemus says that he studied philosophy on the principle of suspending his judgment on all points, without however, on any occasion acting in an imprudent manner, or doing anything without due consideration. And he lived to nearly ninety years of age.</p>
				<p>And Antigonus of Carystus, in his account of Pyrrho, mentions the following circumstances respecting him: that he was originally a person of no reputation, but a poor man, and a painter; and that a picture of some camp-bearers, of very moderate execution, was preserved in the Gymnasium at Elis, which was his work; and that he used to walk out into the fields and seek solitary places, very rarely appearing to his family at home; and that he did this in consequence of having heard some Indian reproaching Anaxarchus for never teaching anyone else any good, but for devoting all his time to paying court to princes in palaces. He relates of him too that he always maintained the same demeanour, so that if anyone left him in the middle of his delivery of a discourse, he remained and continued what he was saying; although, when a young man, he was of a very excitable temperament. Often too, says Antigonus, he would go away for a time without telling anyone beforehand, and taking any chance persons whom he chose for his companions. And once, when Anaxarchus had fallen into a pond, he passed by without assisting him; and when someone blamed him for this, Anaxarchus himself praised his indifference and absence of all emotion.</p>
				<p>On one occasion he was detected talking to himself, and when he was asked the reason, he said that he was studying how to be good. In his investigations he was never despised by anyone, because he always spoke explicitly and straight to the question that had been put to him. On which account Nausiphanes was charmed by him even when he was quite young. And he used to say that he should like to be endowed with the disposition of Pyrrho, without losing his own power of eloquence. And he said too that Epicurus, who admired the conversation and manners of Pyrrho, was frequently asking him about him.</p>
				<p>He was so greatly honored by his country that he was appointed a priest; and on his account all the philosophers were exempted from taxation. He had a great many imitators of his impassiveness; in reference to which Timon speaks thus of him in his Python, and in his Silloi:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Now, you old man, you Pyrrho, how could you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Find an escape from all the slavish doctrines</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And vain imaginations of the Sophists?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How did you free yourself from all the bonds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sly chicane, and artful deep persuasion?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How came you to neglect what sort of breeze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blows round your Greece, and what’s the origin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And end of everything?</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And again, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Images</i>, he says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>These things, my heart, O Pyrrho, longs to hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How you enjoy such ease of life and quiet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only man as happy as a God.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And the Athenians presented him with the freedom of their city, as Diocles tells us, because he had slain Cotys the Thracian.</p>
				<p>He also lived in a most blameless manner with his sister, who was a midwife, as Eratosthenes relates in his treatise on Riches and Poverty; so that he himself used to carry poultry, and pigs too if he could get any, into the marketplace and sell them. And he used to clean all the furniture of the house without expressing any annoyance. And it is said that he carried his indifference so far that he even washed a pig. And once, when he was very angry about something connected with his sister (and her name was Philista), and someone took him up, he said: “The display of my indifference does not depend on a woman.” On another occasion, when he was driven back by a dog which was attacking him, he said to someone who blamed him for being discomposed: “That it was a difficult thing entirely to put off humanity; but that a man ought to strive with all his power to counteract circumstances with his actions if possible, and at all events with his reason.” They also tell a story that once, when some medicines of a consuming tendency, and some cutting and cautery was applied to him for some wound, that he never even contracted his brow. And Timon intimates his disposition plainly enough in the letters which he wrote to Python. Moreover, Philo the Athenian, who was a friend of his, said that he was especially fond of Democritus; and next to him of Homer; whom he admired greatly, and was continually saying:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>But as the race of falling leaves decay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such is the fate of man.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-132" id="noteref-132" epub:type="noteref">132</a></span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">He used also, as it is said, to compare men to wasps and flies and birds, and to quote the following lines:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Die then, my friend, what boots it to deplore?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The great, the good Patroclus is no more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He, far thy better, was foredoom’d to die;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thou, doest thou bewail mortality?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-133" id="noteref-133" epub:type="noteref">133</a></span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">And so he would quote anything that bore on the uncertainty and emptiness and fickleness of the affairs of man. Posidonius tells the following anecdote about him: that when some people who were sailing with him were looking gloomy because of a storm, he kept a calm countenance, and comforted their minds, exhibiting himself on deck eating a pig, and saying that it became a wise man to preserve an untroubled spirit in that manner. Numenius is the only writer who asserts that he used to deliver positive dogmas.</p>
				<p>He had many eminent disciples, and among them Eurylochus, of whom the following defective characteristic is related: for they say that he was once worked up to such a pitch of rage that he took up a spit with the meat on it, and chased the cook as far as the marketplace. And once in Elis he was so harassed by some people who put questions to him in the middle of his discourses, that he threw down his cloak and swam across the Alpheus. He was the greatest possible enemy to the Sophists, as Timon tells us. But Philo, on the contrary, was very fond of arguing; on which account Timon speaks of him thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Avoiding men to study all devoted,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He ponders with himself, and never heeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The glory or disputes which harass Philo.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">Besides these disciples, Pyrrho also had Hecateus of Abdera, and Timon the Phliasian, who wrote the Silloi and whom we shall speak of hereafter; and also Nausiphanes of Teos, who, as some say, was the master of Epicurus.</p>
				<p>All these men were called Pyrrhoneans from their master; and also doubters, and skeptics, and ephectics, or suspenders of their judgment, and investigators, from their principles. And their philosophy was called investigatory, from their investigating or seeking the truth on all sides; and skeptical from their being always doubting (<i xml:lang="grc">σκέπτομαι</i>), and never finding; and ephectic, from the disposition which they encouraged after investigation, I mean the suspending of their judgment (<i xml:lang="grc">ἐποχὴ</i>); and doubting, because they asserted that the dogmatic philosophers only doubted, and that they did the same. [And they were called Pyrrhoneans from Pyrrho himself.]</p>
				<p>But Theodosius, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Chapters on Skepticism</i>, contends that we ought not to call the Pyrrhonean school skeptical; for since, says he, the motion and agitation of the mind in each individual is incomprehensible to others, we are unable to know what was the disposition of Pyrrho; and if we do not know it we ought not to be called Pyrrhoneans. He also adds that Pyrrho was not the original inventor of Skepticism, and that he had no particular dogma of any kind; and that, consequently, it can only be called Pyrrhonism from some similarity. Some say that Homer was the original founder of this school; since he at different times gives different accounts of the same circumstance, as much as anyone else ever did; and since he never dogmatizes definitively respecting affirmation; they also say that the maxims of the seven wise men were skeptical; such as that “Seek nothing in excess,” and that “Suretyship is near calamity;” which shows that calamity follows a man who has given positive and certain surety; they also argue that Archilochus and Euripides were Skeptics; and Archilochus speaks thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>And now, O Glaucus, son of Leptines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such is the mind of mortal man, which changes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With every day that Jupiter doth send.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">And Euripides says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Why then do men assert that wretched mortals</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are with true wisdom gifted; for on you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We all depend; and we do everything</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which pleases you.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">Moreover, Xenophanes, and Zeno the Eleatic, and Democritus were also Skeptics; of whom Xenophanes speaks thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>And no man knows distinctly anything,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no man ever will.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">And Zeno endeavors to put an end to the doctrine of motion by saying: “The object moved does not move either in the place in which it is, or in that in which it is not.” Democritus, too, discards the qualities, where he says: what is cold is cold in opinion, and what is hot is hot in opinion; but atoms and the vacuum exist in reality. And again he says: “But we know nothing really; for truth lies in the bottom.” Plato, too, following them, attributes the knowledge of the truth to the Gods and to the sons of the Gods, and leaves men only the investigation of probability. And Euripides says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Who now can tell whether to live may not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be properly to die. And whether that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which men do call to die, may not in truth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be but the entrance into real life?</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And Empedocles speaks thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>These things are not perceptible to sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor to the ears, nor comprehensible</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To human intellect.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And in a preceding passage he says:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Believing nothing, but such circumstances</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As have befallen each.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Heraclitus, too, says, “Let us not form conjectures at random about things of the greatest importance.” And Hippocrates delivers his opinion in a very doubtful manner, such as becomes a man; and before them all Homer has said:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Long in the field of words we may contend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reproach is infinite and knows no end.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And immediately after:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Armed, or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(So voluble a weapon is the tongue),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wounded we wound, and neither side can fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For every man has equal strength to rail:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-134" id="noteref-134" epub:type="noteref">134</a></span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">Intimating the equal vigour and antithetical force of words. And the Skeptics persevered in overthrowing all the dogmas of every sect, while they themselves asserted nothing dogmatically; and contented themselves with expressing the opinions of others, without affirming anything themselves, not even that they did affirm nothing; so that they even discarded all positive denial, for to say “We affirm nothing” was to affirm something. “But we,” said they, “enunciate the doctrines of others, to prove our own perfect indifference; it is just as if we were to express the same thing by a simple sign.” So these words⁠—“We affirm nothing”⁠—indicate the absence of all affirmation, just as other propositions, such as: “Not more one thing than another” or “Every reason has a corresponding reason opposed to it,” and all such maxims indicate a similar idea. But the phrase “Not more one thing,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, has sometimes an affirmative sense, indicating the equality of certain things, as for instance in this sentence: “A pirate is not worse than a liar.” But by the skeptics this is said not positively, but negatively, as for instance where the speaker contests a point and says: “It was not Scylla, any more than it was Chimaera.” And the word “more” itself is sometimes used to indicate a comparison, as when we say: “That honey is more sweet than grapes.” And at other times it is used positively, and at the same time negatively, as when we say: “Virtue profits us more than hurts us;” for in this phrase we intimate that virtue does profit, and does not hurt us. But the Skeptics abolish the whole expression “Not more than it;” saying, that “Prudence has not existence, any more than it has no existence.” Accordingly, then, expression, as Timon says in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Python</i>, indicates nothing more than an absence of all affirmation, or of all assent of the judgment.</p>
				<p>Also the expression “Every reason has a corresponding reason,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, does in the same manner indicate the suspension of the judgment; for if, while the facts are different, the expressions are equipollent, it follows that a man must be quite ignorant of the real truth.</p>
				<p>Besides this, to this assertion there is a contrary assertion opposed, which, after having destroyed all others, turns itself against itself, and destroys itself, resembling, as it were, those cathartic medicines which, after they have cleansed the stomach, then discharge themselves and are got rid of. And so the dogmatic philosophers say that all these reasonings are so far from overturning the authority of reason that they confirm it. To this the Skeptics reply that they only employ reason as an instrument, because it is impossible to overturn the authority of reason without employing reason; just as if we assert that there is no such thing as space, we must employ the word “space,” but that not dogmatically, but demonstratively; and if we assert that nothing exists according to necessity, it is unavoidable that we must use the word “necessity.” The same principle of interpretation did they adopt, for they affirmed that facts are not by nature such as they appear to be, but that they only seem such; and they said that what they doubt is not what they think, for their thoughts are evident to themselves, but the reality of the things which are only made known to them by their sensations.</p>
				<p>The Pyrrhonean system, then, is a simple explanation of appearances, or of notions of every kind, by means of which, comparing one thing with another, one arrives at the conclusion that there is nothing in all these notions but contradiction and confusion; as Aenesidemus says in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Introduction to Pyrrhonism</i>. As to the contradictions which are found in those speculations, when they have pointed out in what way each fact is convincing, they then, by the same means, take away all belief from it; for they say that we regard as certain those things which always produce similar impressions on the senses, those which are the offspring of habit, or which are established by the laws, and those too which give pleasure or excite wonder. And they prove that the reasons opposite to those on which our assent is founded are entitled to equal belief.</p>
				<p>The difficulties which they suggest, relating to the agreement subsisting between what appears to the senses and what is comprehended by the intellect, divide themselves into ten modes of argument, according to which the subject and object of our knowledge is incessantly changing. And these ten modes Pyrrho lays down in the following manner:</p>
				<p>The first relates to the difference which one remarks between the sentiments of animals in respect of pleasure, and pain, and what is injurious, and what is advantageous; and from this we conclude that the same objects do not always produce the same impressions, and that the fact of this difference ought to be a reason with us for suspending our judgment. For there are some animals which are produced without any sexual connection, as those which live in the fire, and the Arabian Phoenix, and worms. Others again are engendered by copulation, as men and others of that kind; and some are composed in one way, and others in another; on which account they also differ in their senses, as for instance, hawks are very keen-sighted; dogs have a most acute scent. It is plain, therefore, that the things seen produce different impressions on those animals which differ in their power of sight. So, too, young branches are eagerly eaten by the goat, but are bitter to mankind; and hemlock is nutritious for the quail, but deadly to man; and pigs eat their own dung, but a horse does not.</p>
				<p>The second mode refers to the nature and idiosyncracies of men. According to Demophon, the steward of Alexander used to feel warm in the shade, and to shiver in the sun. And Andron the Argive, as Aristotle tells us, travelled through the dry parts of Libya without once drinking. Again, one man is fond of medicine, another of farming, another of commerce; and the same pursuits are good for one man and injurious to another; on which account we ought to suspend our opinions.</p>
				<p>The third mode is that which has for its object the difference of the organs of sense. Accordingly, an apple presents itself to the sight as yellow, to the taste as sweet, to the smell as fragrant; and the same form is seen in very different lights, according to the differences of mirrors. It follows, therefore, that what is seen is just as likely to be something else as the reality.</p>
				<p>The fourth refers to the dispositions of the subject, and the changes in general to which it is liable: such as health, sickness, sleep, waking, joy, grief, youth, old age, courage, fear, want, abundance, hatred, friendship, warmth, cold, easiness of breathing, oppression of the respiratory organs, and so on. The objects, therefore, appear different to us according to the disposition of the moment; for even madmen are not in a state contrary to nature. For, why are we to say that of them more than of ourselves? For we too look at the sun as if it stood still. Theon of Tithora, the Stoic, used to walk about in his sleep; and a slave of Pericles’s used, when in the same state, to walk on the top of the house.</p>
				<p>The fifth mode is conversant with laws, and established customs, and belief in mythical traditions, and the conventions of art, and dogmatical opinions. This mode embraces all that relates to vice and to honesty; to the true and to the false; to the good and to the bad; to the Gods and to the production and destruction of all visible objects. Accordingly, the same action is just in the case of some people, and unjust in that of others. And good in the case of some, and bad in that of others. On this principle we see that the Persians do not think it unnatural for a man to marry his daughter; but among the Greeks it is unlawful. Again, the Massagetae, as Eudoxus tells us in the first book of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Travels Over the World</i>, have their women in common; but the Greeks do not. And the Cilicians delight in piracy, but the Greeks avoid it. So again, different nations worship different Gods; and some believe in the providence of God, and others do not. The Egyptians embalm their dead, and then bury them; the Romans burn them; the Paeonians throw them into the lakes. All these considerations show that we ought to suspend our judgment.</p>
				<p>The sixth mode has reference to the promiscuousness and confusion of objects, according to which nothing is seen by us simply and by itself, but in combination either with air, or with light, or with moisture, or with solidity, or heat, or cold, or motion, or evaporation or some other power. Accordingly, purple exhibits a different hue in the sun, and in the moon, and in a lamp. And our own complexions appear different when seen at noonday and at sunset. And a stone which one cannot lift in the air, is easily displaced in the water, either because it is heavy itself and is made light by the water, or because it is light in itself and is made heavy by the air. So that we cannot positively know the peculiar qualities of anything, just as we cannot discover oil in ointment.</p>
				<p>The seventh mode has reference to distances, and position, and space, and to the objects which are in space. In this mode one establishes the fact that objects which we believe to be large, sometimes appear small; that those which we believe to be square, sometimes appear round; that those which we fancy even, appear full of projections; those which we think straight, seem bent; and those which we believe to be colorless, appear of quite a different complexion. Accordingly, the sun, on account of its distance from us, appears small. The mountains too, at a distance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-135" id="noteref-135" epub:type="noteref">135</a> appear airy masses and smooth, but when beheld close, they are rough. Again, the sun has one appearance at his rise, and quite a different one at midday. And the same body looks very different in a wood from what it does on plain ground. So too, the appearance of an object changes according to its position as regards us; for instance, the neck of a dove varies as it turns. Since then, it is impossible to view these things irrespectively of place and position, it is clear that their real nature is not known.</p>
				<p>The eighth mode has respect to the magnitudes or quantities of things; or to the heat or coldness, or to the speed or slowness, or to the paleness or variety of color of the subject. For instance, a moderate quantity of wine when taken invigorates, but an excessive quantity weakens. And the same is the case with food, and other similar things.</p>
				<p>The ninth depends upon the frequency, or rarity, or strangeness of the thing under consideration. For instance, earthquakes excite no wonder among those nations with whom they are of frequent occurrence; nor does the sun, because he is seen every day.</p>
				<p>The ninth mode is called by Phavorinus the eighth, and by Sextus and Aenesidemus the tenth; and Sextus calls the tenth the eighth, which Phavorinus reckons the tenth as the ninth in order.</p>
				<p>The tenth mode refers to the comparison between one thing and another; as for instance between what is light and what is heavy, between what is strong and what is weak, between what is greater and what is less, what is above and what is below. For instance, that which is on the right is not on the right intrinsically and by nature, but it is looked upon as such in consequence of its relation to something else; and if that other thing be transposed, then it will no longer be on the right. In the same way, a man is spoken of as a father, or brother, or relation to someone else; and day is called so in relation to the sun; and everything has its distinctive name in relation to human thought; therefore, those things which are known in relation to others are unknown of themselves.</p>
				<p>And these are the ten modes.</p>
				<p>But Agrippa adds five other modes to them: One derived from the disagreement of opinions; another from the necessity of proceeding <i xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> from one reasoning to another; a third from relation; a fourth from hypothesis; and the last from the reciprocal nature of proofs.</p>
				<p>That which refers to the disagreement of opinions, shows that all the questions which philosophers propose to themselves, or which people in general discuss, are full of uncertainty and contradiction.</p>
				<p>That which is derived from the necessity of proceeding incessantly from one reasoning to another, demonstrates that it is impossible for a man ever, in his researches, to arrive at undeniable truth; since one truth is only to be established by another truth; and so on, <i xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>.</p>
				<p>The mode which is derived from relation rests on the doctrine that no object is ever perceived independently and entirely by itself, but always in its relation to something else; so that it is impossible to know its nature correctly.</p>
				<p>That which depends on hypothesis is directed against those arguers who pretend that it is necessary to accept the principles of things taken absolutely, and that one must place one’s faith in them without any examination, which is an absurdity, for one may just as well lay down the opposite principles.</p>
				<p>The fifth mode, that one namely which arises from the reciprocal nature of proofs, is capable of application whenever the proof of the truth which we are looking for supposes, as a necessary preliminary, our belief in that truth; for instance, if after we have proved the porosity of bodies by their evaporations, we return and prove the evaporations by the porosity.</p>
				<p>These Skeptics then deny the existence of any demonstration, of any test of truth, of any signs, or causes, or motion, or learning, and of anything as intrinsically or naturally good or bad. For every demonstration, say they, depends either on things which demonstrate themselves, or on principles which are indemonstrable. If on things which demonstrate themselves, then these things themselves require demonstration, and so on <i xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. If on principles which are indemonstrable, then the very moment that either the sum total of these principles, or even one single one of them, is incorrectly urged, the whole demonstration falls instantly to pieces. But if anyone supposes, they add, that there are principles which require no demonstration, that man deceives himself strangely, not seeing that it is necessary for him in the first place to establish this point, that they contain their proof in themselves. For a man cannot prove that there are four elements because there are four elements.</p>
				<p>Besides, if particular proofs are denied in a complex demonstration, it must follow that the whole demonstration is also incorrect. Again, if we are to know that an argument is really a demonstrative proof, we must have a test of truth; and in order to establish a test, we require a demonstrative proof; and these two things must be devoid of every kind of certainty, since they bear reciprocally the one on the other.</p>
				<p>How then is anyone to arrive at certainty about obscure matters, if one is ignorant even how one ought to attempt to prove them? For what one is desirous to understand is not what the appearance of things is, but what their nature and essence is.</p>
				<p>They show, too, that the dogmatic philosophers act with great simplicity; for that the conclusions which they draw from their hypothetical principles are not scientific truths but mere suppositions; and that, in the same manner, one might establish the most improbable propositions. They also say that those who pretend that one ought not to judge of things by the circumstances which surround them, or by their accessories, but that one ought to take their nature itself as one’s guide, do not perceive that, while they pretend to give the precise measure and definition of everything, if the objects present such and such an appearance, that depends solely on their position and relative arrangement. They conclude from thence, that it is necessary to say that everything is true, or that everything is false. For if certain things only are true, how is one to recognize them? Evidently it will not be the senses which judge in that case of the objects of sensation, for all appearances are equal to the senses; nor will it be the intellect, for the same reason. But besides these two faculties, there does not appear to be any other test or criterion at all. So, say they, if we desire to arrive at any certainty with respect to any object which comes under either sense or intellect, we must first establish those opinions which are laid down previously as bearing on those objects. For some people have denied this doctrine, and others have overturned that; it is therefore indispensable that they should be judged of either by the senses or by the intellect. And the authority of each of these faculties is contested; it is therefore impossible to form a positive judgment of the operations of the senses and of the intellect; and if the contest between the different opinions compels us to a neutrality, then the measure which appeared proper to apply to the appreciation of all those objects is at the same time put an end to, and one must fix a similar valuation on everything.</p>
				<p>Perhaps our opponent will say, “Are then appearances trustworthy or deceitful?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a> We answer that if they are trustworthy, the other side has nothing to object to those to whom the contrary appearance presents itself. For, as he who says that such and such a thing appears to him is trustworthy, so also is he who says that the contrary appears to him. And if appearances are deceitful, then they do not deserve any confidence when they assert what appears to them to be true. We are not bound then to believe that a thing is true merely because it obtains assent. For all men do not yield to the same reasons; and even the same individual does not always see things in the same light. Persuasion often depends on external circumstances, on the authority of the speaker, on his ability, on the elegance of his language, on habit, or even on pleasure.</p>
				<p>They also, by this train of reasoning, suppress the criterion of truth. Either the criterion has been decided on, or it has not. And if it has not, it does not deserve any confidence, and it cannot be of any use at all in aiding us to discern truth from falsehood. If, on the other hand, it has been decided on, it then enters into the class of particular things which require a criterion, and in that case to judge and to be judged amount to the same thing; the criterion which judges is itself judged of by something else, that again by a third criterion, and so on <i xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. Add to this, say they, the fact that people are not even agreed as to the nature of the criterion of truth: some say that man is the criterion, others that it is the senses which are so; one set places reason in the van, another class rely upon cataleptic perception.</p>
				<p>As to man himself, he disagrees both with himself and with others, as the diversity of laws and customs proves. The senses are deceivers, and reason disagrees with itself. Cataleptic perception is judged of by the intellect, and the intellect changes in various manners; accordingly, we can never find any positive criterion, and in consequence, truth itself wholly eludes our search.</p>
				<p>They also affirm that there are no such things as signs; for if there are signs, they argue they must be such as are apprehended either by the senses or by the intellect. Now, there are none which are apprehended by the senses, for everything which is apprehended by the senses is general, while a sign is something particular. Moreover, any object which is apprehended by the senses has an existence of its own, while signs are only relative. Again, signs are not apprehended by the intellect, for in that case they would be either the visible manifestation of a visible thing, or the invisible manifestation of an invisible thing, or the invisible sign of a visible thing, or the visible sign of an invisible thing. But none of all these cases are possible; there are therefore no such things as signs at all.</p>
				<p>There is therefore no such thing as a visible sign of a visible thing; for that which is visible has no need of a sign. Nor, again, is there any invisible sign of an invisible thing; for when anything is manifested by means of another thing, it must become visible. On the same principle there is no invisible sign of a visible object; for that which aids in the perception of something else must be visible. Lastly, there is no visible manifestation of an invisible thing; for as a sign is something wholly relative, it must be perceived in that of which it is the sign; and that is not the case. It follows, therefore, that none of those things which are not visible in themselves admit of being perceived; for one considers signs as things which aid in the perception of that which is not evident by itself.</p>
				<p>They also wholly discard, and, as far as depends on them, overturn the idea of any cause, by means of this same train of reasoning. Cause is something relative. It is relative to that of which it is the cause. But that which is relative is only conceived, and has no real existence. The idea of a cause then is a pure conception; for, inasmuch as it is a cause, it must be a cause of something; otherwise it would be no cause at all. In the same way as a father cannot be a father, unless there exists some being in respect of whom one gives him the title of father; so too a cause stands on the same ground. For, supposing that nothing exists relatively to which a cause can be spoken of; then, as there is no production, or destruction, or anything of that sort, there can likewise be no cause. However, let us admit that there are such things as causes. In that case then, either a body must be the cause of a body, or that which is incorporeal must be the cause of that which is incorporeal. Now neither of these cases is possible, therefore, there is no such thing as cause. In fact, one body cannot be the cause of another body, since both bodies must have the same nature; and if it be said that one is the cause, inasmuch as it is a body, then the other must be a cause for the same reason. And in that case one would have two reciprocal causes; two agents without any passive subject.</p>
				<p>Again, one incorporeal thing cannot be the cause of another incorporeal thing for the same reason. Also, an incorporeal thing cannot be the cause of a body, because nothing that is incorporeal can produce a body. Nor, on the other hand, can a body be the cause of anything incorporeal, because in every production there must be some passive subject matter; but, as what is incorporeal is by its own nature protected from being a passive subject, it cannot be the object of any productive power. There is, therefore, no such thing as any cause at all. From all which it follows that the first principles of all things have no reality; for such a principle, if it did exist, must be both the agent and the efficient cause.</p>
				<p>Again, there is no such thing as motion. For whatever is moved, is moved either in the place in which it is, or in that in which it is not. It certainly is not moved in the place in which it is, and it is impossible that it should be moved in the place in which it is not; therefore, there is no such thing as motion at all.</p>
				<p>They also denied the existence of all learning. If, said they, anything is taught, then either that which does exist is taught in its existence or that which does not exist is taught in its nonexistence; but that which does exist is not taught in its existence (for the nature of all existent things is visible to all men, and is known by all men); nor is that which does not exist taught in its nonexistence, for nothing can happen to that which does not exist, so that to be taught cannot happen to it.</p>
				<p>Nor again, say they, is there any such thing as production. For that which is, is not produced, for it exists already; nor that which is not, for that does not exist at all. And that which has no being nor existence at all, cannot be produced.</p>
				<p>Another of their doctrines is that there is no such thing as any natural good or natural evil. For if there be any natural good or natural evil, then it must be good to everyone or evil to everyone; just as snow is cold to everyone. But there is no such thing as one general good or evil which is common to all beings; therefore, there is no such thing as any natural good or natural evil. For either one must pronounce everything good which is thought so by anyone whatever, or one must say that it does not follow that everything which is thought good is good. Now, we cannot say that everything which is thought good is good, since the same thing is thought good by one person (as, for instance, pleasure is thought good by Epicurus) and evil by another (as it is thought evil by Antisthenes); and on this principle the same thing will be both good and evil. If, again, we assert that it does not follow that everything which is thought good is good, then we must distinguish between the different opinions; which it is not possible to do by reason of the equality of the reasons adduced in support of them. It follows that we cannot recognize anything as good by nature.</p>
				<p>And we may also take a view of the whole of their system by the writings which some of them have left behind them. Pyrrho himself has left nothing, but his friends Timon, and Aenesidemus, and Numenius, and Nausiphanes, and others of that class have left books. And the dogmatical philosophers arguing against them say that they also adopt spurious and pronounce positive dogmas. For where they think that they are refuting others they are convicted, for in the very act of refutation, they assert positively and dogmatize. For when they say that they define nothing, and that every argument has an opposite argument; they do here give a positive definition, and assert a positive dogma. But they reply to these objectors; as to the things which happen to us as men, we admit the truth of what you say; for we certainly do know that it is day, and that we are alive; and we admit that we know many other of the phenomena of life. But with respect to those things as to which the dogmatic philosophers make positive assertions, saying that they are comprehended, we suspend our judgment on the ground of their being uncertain; and we know nothing but the passions; for we confess that we see, and we are aware that we comprehend that such a thing is the fact; but we do not know how we see, or how we comprehend. Also, we state in the way of narrative, that this appears white, without asserting positively that it really is so. And with respect to the assertion “We define nothing,” and other sentences of that sort, we do not pronounce them as dogmas. For to say that is a different kind of statement from saying that the world is spherical; for the one fact is not evident, while the other statements are mere admissions.</p>
				<p>While, therefore, we say that we define nothing, we do not even say that as a definition.</p>
				<p>Again, the dogmatic philosophers say that the Skeptics overthrow all life when they deny everything of which life consists. But the Skeptics say that they are mistaken; for they do not deny that they see, but that they do not know how it is that they see. For, say they, we assert what is actually the fact, but we do not describe its character. Again, we feel that fire burns, but we suspend our judgment as to whether it has a burning nature. Also, we see whether a person moves, and that a man dies; but how these things happen we know not. Therefore, say they, we only resist the uncertain deductions which are put by the side of evident facts. For when we say that an image has projections, we only state plainly what is evident; but when we say that it has not projections, we no longer say what appears evident, but something else. On which account Timon, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Python</i>, says that Pyrrho does not destroy the authority of custom. And in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Images</i> he speaks thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>But what is evidently seen prevails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherever it may be.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="continued">And in his treatise on the Senses, he says, “The reason why a thing is sweet I do not declare, but I confess that the fact of sweetness is evident.” So too, Aenesidemus, in the first book of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Pyrrhonean Discourses</i>, says that Pyrrho defines nothing dogmatically, on account of the possibility of contradiction, but that he is guided by what is evident. And he says the same thing in his book against Wisdom, and in his treatise on Investigation.</p>
				<p>In like manner, Zeuxis, a friend of Aenesidemus, in his treatise on Twofold Arguments, and Antiochus, of Laodicea, and Apellas, in his Agrippa, all declare nothing beyond what is evident. The criterion therefore, among the Skeptics, is that which is evident; as Aenesidemus also says; and Epicurus says the same thing.</p>
				<p>But Democritus says that there is no test whatever of appearances, and also that they are not criteria of truth. Moreover, the dogmatic philosophers attack the criterion derived from appearances, and say that the same objects present at times different appearances; so that a town presents at one time a square, and at another a round appearance; and that consequently, if the Skeptic does not discriminate between different appearances, he does nothing at all. If, on the contrary, he determines in favor of either, then, say they, he no longer attaches equal value to all appearances. The Skeptics reply to this, that in the presence of different appearances, they content themselves with saying that there are many appearances, and that it is precisely because things present themselves under different characters that they affirm the existence of appearances.</p>
				<p>Lastly, the Skeptics say that the chief good is the suspension of the judgment, which tranquillity of mind follows, like its shadow, as Timon and Aenesidemus say; for that we need not choose these things, or avoid those, which all depend on ourselves: but as to those things which do not depend upon us, but upon necessity, such as hunger, thirst, and pain, those we cannot avoid; for it is not possible to put an end to them by reason.</p>
				<p>But when the dogmatic philosophers object that the Skeptic, on his principles, will not refuse to kill his own father if he is ordered to do so; so that they answer that they can live very well without disquieting themselves about the speculations of the dogmatic philosophers; but, suspending their judgment in all matters which do not refer to living and the preservation of life. Accordingly, say they, we avoid some things and we seek others, following custom in that; and we obey the laws.</p>
				<p>Some authors have asserted that the chief good of the Stoics is impassibility; others say that it is mildness and tranquillity.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Timon</h3>
				<p>Apollonides, of Nicaea, a philosopher of our school, in the first book of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Commentaries on the Silloi</i>, which he dedicated to Tiberius Caesar, says that Timon was the son of Timarchus, and a Phliasian by birth. And then, when he was young, he studied dancing, and afterwards he renounced that study and went to Megara to Stilpo. And having spent some time there, he returned home again and married. Then he came with his wife to Elis, to see Pyrrho, and there he remained while his children were born, the elder of whom he called Xanthus, and taught him medicine, and left him his successor in his sect of philosophy. And he was a man of considerable eminence, as Sotion tells us in his eleventh book. Afterwards, being in difficulty as to his means, he departed to the Hellespont and the Propontis; and living at Chalcedon as a Sophist, he earned a very high reputation and great popularity; from thence he departed, after having made a considerable fortune, and went to Athens, and remained there till his death, going across once for a short time to Thebes. He was also acquainted with king Antigonus, and with Ptolemy Philadelphus, as he himself testifies in his Iambics.</p>
				<p>He was, says Antigonus, fond of drinking, and he at times occupied himself with works quite inconsistent with philosophy; for he wrote lyric and epic poems, and tragedies and satiric dramas, and thirty comedies, and sixty tragedies and Silloi, and amatory poems.</p>
				<p>There are works of his also enumerated in a regular catalog, extending to twenty thousand verses, which are mentioned by Antigonus of Carystos, who also wrote his life. Of the Silloi, there are three volumes; in which he attacks everyone as if he were a Skeptic, and especially he lampoons the dogmatic philosophers under the form of parodies. The first volume of these Silloi contains a long uninterrupted narration; but the second and third are in the form of dialogues. He is represented in them as interrogating Xenophanes the Colophonian about everything, and he utters a long continued discourse; in his second book he speaks of the more ancient philosophers; and in his third of the more modern ones; on which account some people have given the last book the name of the epilogue.</p>
				<p>But the first book contains the same subjects, with this difference: that in that it is all confined to one single person and its first line begins thus:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Come hither, all you over-busy Sophists</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>He died when he was nearly ninety years old, as Antigonus tells us; and Sotion, in his eleventh book, makes the same statement. I have heard it said that he had only one eye, and, indeed, he used to call himself Cyclops.</p>
				<p>There was also another Timon, the misanthrope.</p>
				<p>Now this philosopher was very fond of a garden, and also of solitude, as we are told by Antigonus. Accordingly it is reported that Hieronymus the Peripatetic said of him, as among the Scythians, both they who fly and they who pursue shoot with the bow, so in the case of the philosophers, those who pursue and those who fly both hunt for pupils, as Timon for instance.</p>
				<p>He was a man of very acute perceptions, and very quick at seeing the ridiculous side of any question: he was also very fond of learning, and a very clever man at devising plots for poets, and at composing dramas. And he used to associate with himself, in the composition of his tragedies, two other poets, named Alexander and Homer; and whenever he was disturbed by his maidservants or by the dogs, he paid no attention to them, studying above all things to live in tranquillity. They tell a story that Aratus asked him how he could procure an entire and correct copy of Homer’s poetry, and he answered: “If he could fall in with an old manuscript which had never been corrected.” And all his works used to lie about at random, and at times half eaten by mice; so that once when he was reading them to Zopyrus the orator, and unrolling a volume, he read whatever passages came first, and when he got to the middle of the book he found a great gap, which he had not previously perceived, so very indifferent was he about such matters.</p>
				<p>His constitution was so vigorous that he could easily go without his dinner. And they say that once when he saw Arcesilaus passing through the forum of the Cercopes, he said: “What are you doing here, where we freemen are?” And he used constantly to quote to those who invoked the testimony of their intellects to judge of the senses:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Attagas and Numenius are met.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a></span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>And this jesting manner was habitual with him. Accordingly he once said to a man who was surprised at everything: “Why do you not wonder that we three men have only four eyes between us?” for he himself had only one eye, no more had Dioscorides, his pupil; but the man to whom he was speaking had his sight unimpaired. On another occasion, he was asked by Arcesilaus why he had come from Thebes, and he said: “To laugh at you all when I see you face to face.” But though he attacked Arcesilaus in his Silloi, he has praised him in the book entitled the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Funeral Banquet of Arcesilaus</i>.</p>
				<p>He had no successor, as Menodotus tells us; but his school ceased, till Ptolemy the Cyrenean reestablished it. According to the account given to us by Hippobotus and Sotion, he had as pupils, Dioscorides of Cyprus, and Nicolochus of Rhodes, and Euphranor of Seleucia, and Praylus of the Troas, who was a man of such constancy of mind that, as Phylarchus relates in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History</i>, he allowed himself to be punished as a traitor wholly undeservedly, not uttering one word of complaint against his fellow citizens; and Euphranor had for his pupil Eubulus of Alexandria, who was the master of Ptolemy, who was the master of Sarpedon and Heraclides. And Heraclides was the master of Aenesidemus of Cnossus, who wrote eight books of Pyrrhonean discourses; he was also the master of Zeuxippus Polites, who was the master of Zeuxis Goniopus, who was the master of Antiochus of Laodicea, in Lycia. Antiochus again, was the master of Menodotus of Nicomedia, a skillful physician, and of Theodas of Laodicea; and Menodotus was the master of Herodotus of Tarsus, the son of Arieus; Herodotus was the master of Sextus Empiricus, who left ten books of Skeptic Maxims, and other excellent works; and Sextus was the master of Saturninus Cythenas, who was also an empiric.</p>
